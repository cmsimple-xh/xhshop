		<h1>XH-Shop</h1>
		<p>A small simple shop for CMSimple_XH</p>
		<hr>
		<section id="requirements">
			<h2>Requirements</h2>
			<ul>
				<li>CMSimple_XH ≥ 1.7.0</li>
				<li>PHP ≥ 5.3.0</li>
				<li>Plugin <a href="https://github.com/cmb69/fa_xh/releases/" target="_blank">FA_XH</a> (is already included since CMSimple_XH 1.7)</li>
				<li>Plugin <a href="http://cmsimple.holgerirmler.de/downloads/hi_fancybox_4.1.zip" target="_blank">FancyBox</a> recommended &#8211; but the shop also works without it.<br>
					(the link is a direct download)</li>
			</ul>
		</section>
		<section id="installation">
			<h2>Installation</h2>
			<ol>
				<li>Backup your CMSimple_XH installation from your server (backup copy).</li>
				<li>Unpack the downloaded ZIP archive on your computer.</li>
			</ol>
			<p> </p>
			<p>After unzipping you will find 3 folders: <code>content</code>, <code>plugins</code> and <code>userfiles</code>. These folders represent the <strong>target</strong> folders of your CMSimple_XH installation – that means <strong>the contents</strong> of these folders have to be copied to the corresponding folders of your CMSimple_XH installation.</p>
			<p><strong>The folder <code>content</code></strong><br>
				Copy the folder <code>xhshop</code> completely into the folder <code>content</code> of your CMSimple_XH installation. This folder contains the <code>catalog.php</code> with all data of all shop items and categories that will be delivered for demonstration. The storage in the content folder has the advantage that the data is preserved in case of a new installation or an update of the shop. In addition, this folder contains another one: <code>tmp_orders</code>, which is used to temporarily store temporary data for PayPal orders.</p>
			<p><strong>The folder <code>plugins</code></strong><br>
				Copy the folder <code>xhshop</code> completely into the plugins folder of your CMSimple_XH installation. This folder contains the XH-Shop plugin. Make sure you have write permissions (0755) for the subdirectories <code>config/</code>, <code>css/</code> and <code>languages/</code> here.</p>
			<p><strong>The folder<code>userfiles</code></strong><br>
				Copy the folder <code>images/shop/</code> contained therein completely into the folder <code>userfiles/images/</code> of your CMSimple_XH installation. This folder contains sample images that are delivered for demonstration purposes. You can remove these demo images later, once you have created your own articles with your own images.</p>
		</section>
		<section id="settings">
			<h2>Administration</h2>
			<h3>Settings</h3>
			<p>Admin-Menu: <code>Plugins ⇒ Xhshop ⇒ Config</code>.</p>
			<p>Here you can change the existing sample settings of the shop. When you move the mouse over the help icons (?), hints about the settings are displayed.</p>
			<h3>Language</h3>
			<p>Admin-Menu: <code>Plugins ⇒ Xhshop ⇒ Language</code>.</p>
			<p>All texts that are output by the plugin in the frontend or in the backend can be found here and can be changed – depending on the currently used language.</p>
			<p>Some special link addresses (e.g. the shop main page, the terms and conditions and the shipping costs) are set here (right above in the <code>Config</code> section). Also the settings for decimal point/comma and thousands separator are done here for the whole shop.</p>
			<h3>Stylesheet</h3>
			<p>Admin-Menu: <code>Plugins ⇒ Xhshop ⇒ Stylesheet</code>.</p>
			<p>The CSS styles of the XH-Shop can be customized here.</p>
		</section>
		<section id="start">
			<h2>Open a Shop</h2>
			Log in to CMSimple_XH and create a new page <code>Shop</code> with the page manager (<code>admin menu ⇒ Pages</code>). On this page, you enter the plugin call. The &quot;normal&quot; call for the XH shop is:
			<p class="code">{{{display_shop();}}}</p>
			<p class="additional"><strong>Note:</strong> If you copy the code from here, then you have to select &quot;Paste as Text&quot; in the editor before pasting. At the end, the call in the html view of the editor should look like this:</p>
			<p class="code">&lt;div&gt;{{{display_shop();}}}&lt;/div&gt;</p>
			It is easily possible to place other elements on the shop page above or below this call. </section>
		<section id="templates">
			<h2>Shop-Templates</h2>
			<p>The HTML output of the XH-Shop is completely controlled by templates. These can be found in the plugin folder <code>/templates</code>.</p>
			<p>If you prefer not to change the original files – and you should really only do this with extreme caution – then simply copy the files you want (for the frontend, for example) into the <code>xhshop/theme/frontend/</code> folder. You can safely experiment with these files. XH-Shop will look at every call if there are files in this folder. If so, it will use these files as priority for the output. If something went wrong, you can rename or remove your changed files – XH-Shop will then use the original files again.</p>
		</section>

		<section id="morehelp">
			<h2>Further Help</h2>
			<p>The XH-Shop is <em>small, fine, and simple</em> – but not trivial. It is not possible to describe all functions and options in this help file. That's why a Wiki has been created, which can be edited by several authors and is available to all users. Here is the address:</p>
			<p><a href="https://github.com/cmsimple-xh/xhshop/wiki" target="_blank">https://github.com/cmsimple-xh/xhshop/wiki</a></p>
			<p>If you encounter questions that have not yet been covered in the wiki, post them in the CMSimple_XH forum, where they are almost always answered quickly and competently:</p>
			<p><a href="https://cmsimpleforum.com/index.php" target="_blank">https://cmsimpleforum.com/</a> </p>

		<section id="thanks">
			<h2>Thanks to</h2>
			<p>Extraordinary thanks are due to Martin Damken (<a href="http://www.zeichenkombinat.de/" target="_blank">zeichenkombinat.de</a>), who originally developed the shop under the name wellrad-Shop. We are especially grateful for his permission to further develop the shop under a different name with the CMSimple_XH community.</p>
			<p>The first new XH-Shop version, based on the wellrad-Shop 1.2.1, was created with significant help from Christoph (cmb), Albert (albert) and Frank (frase) – thanks for that.</p>
			<p>Even if already mentioned, Christoph (cmb) must be given special thanks at this point. He did the main programming work and made sure that CMSimple_XH integration was better.</p>
			<p>Last but not least, many thanks to <a href="http://harteg.dk/">Peter Harteg</a>, the father of CMSimple, and all the developers of <a href="http://www.cmsimple-xh.org/">CMSimple_XH</a>, without whom this fantastic CMS would not exist.</p>
